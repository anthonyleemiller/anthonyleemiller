👋 Hi, I’m @anthonyleemiller

After graduating with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering, I work an an IE in the retail business space.

I am extremely interested in building my programming skills as a hobby and seeing where it takes me!

My goal is to work on my data science skills and maybe some extra cool projects here and there.
