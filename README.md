ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anthonyleemiller

After graduating from the University of South Florida with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering, I moved into the logistics industry.

I am extremely interested in building my programming skills as a hobby and seeing where it takes me.

Currently, my goal is to complete the Odin Project to fully develop HTML, CSS, Javacript, and skills in other languages to see where it takes me. Please check out my progress below
