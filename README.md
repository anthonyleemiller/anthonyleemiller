- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anthonyleemiller
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and engineering

After graduating from the University of South Florida with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering, I moved and am currently in the logistics industry.

I am extremely interested in data science and am working on my programming skills to fortify this interest!
